Use this for debugging your globs. By default, it is FALSE.<LINE>- \"keep_dependency\" will determine whether to keep Extra Parameters as a dependency. Enable this if your mod directly patches Extra Parameters. By default, it is FALSE.<LINE><LINE>This mod is compatible with Better Workshop Uploader.<LINE><LINE>Github Repository: https://github.com/upquilled/uql-extra",
